<h1>Data Science</h1>
<p>Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining.
Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science, in particular from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization.
Data scientists use their data and analytical ability to find and interpret rich data sources; manage large amounts of data despite hardware, software, and bandwidth constraints; merge data sources; ensure consistency of datasets; create visualizations to aid in understanding data; build mathematical models using the data; and present and communicate the data insights/findings. They are often expected to produce answers in days rather than months, work by exploratory analysis and rapid iteration, and to produce and present results with dashboards (displays of current values) rather than papers/reports, as statisticians normally do</p>

<h1>Relevance of data Science in Uganda</h1>
<p>There’s lot’s of data out there, but much of it is not in an easy to use format such as data from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, various Ministries, parastatals and institutions such as the Uganda Communications Commissions, URA and so many more. Data scientists in Uganda have to neatly analyse, combine this data and package it in a format that is well understood and be made useful.
The visualization and modelling of the various sets of the data has assisted individuals, agencies and government institutions makes decisions from a more informed view.</P>

<p>Data science has especially been employed in the ministry of Works where the GIS data, the lands information is combined and analysed so as to aid the officials cut costs in demarcation of road sites.</P>

<p>Data science has also assisted the ministry of gender analyse the activities of the youth and gauge their various interests so as to advise government on areas of youths’ empowerment and investments</p>

<p>Not only is it relevant to government agencies; many private organizations in Uganda have embraced data science as it has successfully aided in adding value to all the business models by using statistics and deep learning to make better decisions and improve hiring. It is also being used to crunch the previous data and predict possible situations and risk so that they can work on avoiding them. More over analysis of this data can really help set a workflow.</p>

<h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
<p>Cloud computing is a form of Internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (such as, computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Basically, Cloud computing allows the users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in either privately owned cloud, or on a third-party server in order to make data accessing mechanisms much more easy and reliable. </p>

<h1>Relevance of Cloud Computing in Uganda</h1>
<p>The main objective of Cloud Computing is to take away the hassle of managing a complex IT infrastructure and instead offer a simple worry-free solution that focuses on making the business operations simpler and more productive.</p>
<p>In Cloud Computing, the IT infrastructure supporting the businesses in Uganda will be hosted in a Data Centre somewhere on the Internet, which is where the term "Cloud" originates from since the Internet itself is traditionally depicted as a cloud in network diagrams.</p>
<p>Also another relevance will benefit medium to large businesses that often require a considerably complex IT infrastructure to support their daily operations; this benefit from Cloud Computing through a concept called Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which as the name implies, offers a complete IT infrastructure to the business with all the flexibility and reliability that is common to the Cloud.</p>

<h1>How Uganda can benefit from Data Science and Cloud Computing</h1>
<h3>Benefit from Data Science</h3>
<OL>
<li>Empowering management and officers to make better decisions</li>
A data scientist who is experienced will serve as a trusted advisor and strategic partner to the management of an institution and ensure that the staff maximizes their analytics’ capabilities. A data scientist will communicate and demonstrate the value of the institution’s analytics product to facilitate an improved process of decision making across the various levels of an organization, through measuring, tracking, and recording all the performance metrics.

<li>Directing the actions based on trends which in turn help in defining goals</li>
A data scientist examines and explores the institution’s data, after which they recommend and prescribe certain actions that will help improve the institution’s performance, and better engage customers, ultimately increasing profitability.

<li>Challenging the staff to adopt best practices and focus on issues that matter.</li>
One of the responsibilities of a data scientist is to ensure that the staff is familiar and well-versed with the organization’s analytics product. They prepare the staff for success with the demonstration of the effective use of the system to extract insight and drive action. Once the staff understands the product capabilities, their focus can shift to addressing the key business challenges.

<li>Identifying opportunities</li>
During their interaction with the organization’s current analytics system, data scientists question the existing processes and assumptions for the purpose of developing additional methods and analytical algorithms. Their job requires them to continuously and constantly improve the value that is derived from the organization’s data.

<li>Decision making with quantifiable, data-driven evidence.</li>
With the arrival of data scientists, data gathering and analyzing from various channels has ruled out the need to take high stake risks.

<li>Testing these decisions</li>
Half of the battle involves making certain decisions and implementing those changes. What about the other half? It is crucial to know how those decisions have affected the organization. This is where a data scientist comes in. It pays to have someone who can measure the key metrics that are related to important changes and quantify their success.

<li>Identification and refining of target audiences.</li>
From Google Analytics to customer surveys, companies will have at least one of the many bases of customer data that is collected. But if it isn’t used well, for instance - to identify demographics, the data wouldn’t be useful.
A data scientist can help with the identification of the key groups with precision, via thorough analysis of disparate sources of data. With this in-depth knowledge, organizations can tailor services and products to customer groups, and help profit margins flourish.

<li>Recruiting the right talent for the organization. </li>
Running through CVs through the day is a daily chore in a recruiter’s life, but that is changing due to big data. With the amount of information available on talent - through social media, corporate databases, and job search websites - data science specialists can work their way through this data and hunt the best of candidates that will fit the organization’s needs.
<p>Recruitment will thus no longer be an exhausting and time consuming human review process. Through mining the vast amount of data that is already available, in-house processing of CVs and applications, and even sophisticated data-driven aptitude tests and games, data science can help your recruitment team make speedier and more accurate selections.</p>

<h3>Benefit from Cloud Computing</h3>
<OL>
<li>asy access to software that is critical to the business operations. Instead of having to purchase costly software licenses and worry about maintaining them, a business can rent software as a service from the Cloud and only pay for how many people use it and how often. Besides saving on cost, Software as a Service (SaaS) also offers great reliability and comes with support, maintenance and updates as part of the service.</li>
<li>Extended access to services as they are available 99% uptime and can be accessed from anywhere as long as there is access to the internet. </li>
<li>Reduced cost in managing of IT infrastructure as they are hosted offsite and outsourced. The organizations will not have to worry about the downtime, server storage, server maintenance and infrastructure managers employment costs.</li>
<li>Companies that utilize cloud computing technologies don’t have to worry about having a disaster relief back-up plan because everything is immediately saved in the external cloud, eliminating the dreaded “My server crashed and I lost all of the lead information”.</li>
<li>Cloud computing is eco-friendly - many small to corporate size companies require the use of more servers to get jobs done because server utilization rates are about 5-10%, whereas cloud utilization rates are in the 70% range. Because cloud computing eliminates in-house servers, there isn’t the need for the constant climate control involved in maintaining servers—eliminating carbon footprints.</li>
