<h1>Mobile Computing</h1>
<p>Mobile computing is a generic term that refers to a variety of devices that allow people to access data and information from wherever they are. Sometimes referred to as "human-computer interaction," mobile computing transports data, voice, and video over a network via a mobile device. Mobile devices can be connected to a local area network (LAN), or they can take advantage of Wi-Fi or wireless technology by connecting via a wireless local area network (WLAN)</p>

<h1>The main concepts in mobile computing are:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Communication - this refers to the infrastructure put in place to ensure that seamless and reliable communication goes on. These would include devices such as protocols, services, bandwidth, and portals necessary to facilitate and support the stated services. The data format is also defined at this stage. This ensures that there is no collision with other existing systems which offer the same service. Since the media is unguided/unbounded, the overlaying infrastructure is basically radio wave-oriented. That is, the signals are carried over the air to intended devices that are capable of receiving and sending similar kinds of signals.
<li>Mobile hardware - this includes mobile devices or device components that receive or access the service of mobility. They would range from portable laptops, smartphones, tablet Pc's, Personal Digital Assistants. These devices will have a receptor medium that is capable of sensing and receiving signals. These devices are configured to operate in full- duplex, whereby they are capable of sending and receiving signals at the same time. They don't have to wait until one device has finished communicating for the other device to initiate communications.</li>
<li>Mobile Software - this is the actual program that runs on the mobile hardware. It deals with the characteristics and requirements of mobile applications. This is the engine of the mobile device. In other terms, it is the operating system of the appliance. It's the essential component that operates the mobile device. 
Since portability is the main factor, this type of computing ensures that users are not tied or pinned to a single physical location, but are able to operate from anywhere. It incorporates all aspects of wireless communications. Some examples of mobile operating systems that offer the platform to run mobile software is Android, Black Berry OS, Apple IOS, Windows Mobile among others.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Characteristics of mobile computing</h1>
<OL>
<li>Portability - The Ability to move a device within a learning environment or to different environments with ease.</li>
<li>Social Interactivity - The ability to share data and collaboration between users.</li>
<li>Context Sensitivity - The ability to gather and respond to real or simulated data unique to a current location, environment, or time.</li>
<li>Connectivity - The ability to be digitally connected for the purpose of communication of data in any environment.</li>
<li>Individual - The ability to use the technology to provide scaffolding on difficult activities and lesson customization for individual learners.</li>
<li>Small Size - Mobile devices are also known as handhelds, palmtops and smart phones due to their roughly phone-like dimensions. A typical mobile device will fit in the average adult's hand or pocket. Some mobile devices may fold or slide from a compact, portable mode to a slightly larger size, revealing built-in keyboards or larger screens. Mobile devices make use of touch screens and small keypads to receive input, maintaining their small size and independence from external interface devices. The standard form of a mobile device allows the user to operate it with one hand, holding the device in the palm or fingers while executing its functions with the thumb.</li>
<li>Wireless Communication - Mobile devices are typically capable of communication with other similar devices, with stationary computers and systems, with networks and portable phones. Base mobile devices are capable of accessing the Internet through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi networks, and many models are equipped to access cell phone and wireless data networks as well. Email and texting are standard ways of communicating with mobile devices, although many are also capable of telephony, and some specialized mobile devices, such as RFID and barcode.</li>

<h1>Internet of Things</h1>
<p>TThe Internet of Things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data. The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention. When IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, virtual power plants, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. 
Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of about 30 billion objects by 2020.

<h1>Characteristics of Internet of Things</h1>
<OL>
<li>Intelligence</li>
Ambient intelligence and autonomous control do not necessarily require Internet structures, either. However, there is a shift in research to integrate the concepts of the Internet of things and autonomous control, with initial outcomes towards this direction considering objects as the driving force for autonomous IoT.
In the future the Internet of Things may be a non-deterministic and open network in which auto-organized or intelligent entities (Web services, SOA components), virtual objects (avatars) will be interoperable and able to act independently (pursuing their own objectives or shared ones) depending on the context, circumstances or environments.

<li>Architecture</li>
Building on top of the Internet of Things, the web of things is an architecture for the application layer of the Internet of Things looking at the convergence of data from IoT devices into Web applications to create innovative use-cases. In order to program and control the flow of information in the Internet of Things, a predicted architectural direction is being called BPM Everywhere which is a blending of traditional process management with process mining and special capabilities to automate the control of large numbers of coordinated devices.

<li>Network architecture</li>
The Internet of things requires huge scalability in the network space to handle the surge of devices. With billions of devices being added to the Internet space, IPv6 will play a major role in handling the network layer scalability. IETF's Constrained Application Protocol, ZeroMQ, and MQTT would provide lightweight data transport.

<li>Complexity</li>
In semi-open or closed loops IoT will often be considered and studied as a complex system due to the huge number of different links, interactions between autonomous actors, and its capacity to integrate new actors. At the overall stage (full open loop) it will likely be seen as a chaotic environment (since systems always have finality). As a practical approach, not all elements in the Internet of things run in a global, public space. Subsystems are often implemented to mitigate the risks of privacy, control and reliability. For example, Domestic Robotics (Domotics) running inside a smart home might only share data within and be available via a local network

<li>Size Considerations</li>
The Internet of Things would encode 50 to 100 trillion objects, and be able to follow the movement of those objects. Human beings in surveyed urban environments are each surrounded by 1000 to 5000 trackable objects.

<li>Space considerations</li>
In the Internet of Things, the precise geographic location of a thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can decide whether or not that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards play a key role in the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.

<h1>Current state of IoT in Uganda</h1>
<p>Here in Uganda there is a low adoption of IoTs mainly because of the fact the latest trendy gadgets are costly to the average earning Ugandan. However, the infrastructure to support IoTs such as fast internet does exist
However, the adoption of mobile computing is fast picking up here due to the following reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>Emergence and adoption of the fast 4G internet by the Internet Service Providers</li>
<li>Affordable smart mobile phones on the market from various companies</li>
<li>Many organizations are offering digital access to their services such as internet banking that has brought in a new crop of young developers to design these applications</li>
<li>The Ugandan population is highly literate and ready to adopt the new mobile and digital technology</li>
<li>Software development hubs have come up and they are promoting mobile computing</li>
</ul>

<h1>Challenges facing adoption of IoTs and Mobile Computing in Uganda</h1>
<OL>
<li>The recent spate of cyber attacks has paused a threat to the adoption and acceptance of IoT</li>
<li>The issue of privacy has also slowed down adoption as many users feel if their cars are connected they may easily be spied on since their locations may be visible</li>
<li>The high cost of internet from the ISPs – this is an issue since government does not regulate the internet costs</li>
<li>The high cost of intelligent gadgets since most of them are imported</li>
<li>Quality of connectivity - mobile devices will need either WiFi connectivity or mobile network connectivity such as GPRS, 3G or even 4G connectivity; so if one is not near any of these connections access to the internet is very limited.</li>
<li>Power Consumption- due to the use of batteries in these devices, these do not tend to last long, if in a situation where there is no source of power for charging then that will certainly be a let-down.</li>
